# Intregated Project (Database)
### This is a database used in the Intregated project course.

### Instuction
The purpose of an Integrated project is to make us familiar with all the working principles of every component of an application. By bringing all the parts together, we hope to understand more and be ready to work in the real world. There are all database versions used in the integrated project. There will be 2 versions in total

- Version 1 will be just a single table task for displaying data and basic CRUD. After

- Version 2, there will be an additional table status. This table will be a foreign key that is a one to many relationship. The database structure must be revised.
